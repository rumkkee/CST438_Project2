Time Taker is a roguelike that allows you to battle monsters, progress through the dungeon, defeat the boss with a unique time rewinding mechanic.

We got styling help for this document from this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Introduction
Communication between the team was managed through daily Discord 8pm meetings and messages.
Messaging was for short communication, progress reporting and alerting out teammembers when new pull requests went up.

Originally we had around 65 stories, with the idea that some stories being stretch goals that wouldn't make it into the final product.

We added stories along the way as the project progressed as we felt we were capable of completing more. As a team we completed 53 out of 65 stories.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I was the lead programmer for Timetaker, primarily focused on systems work.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest challenge I faced was creating custom pathfinding for enemies, which was a first for me but overall really enjoyable.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + The challenge was making it work for the type of game we were trying to create, with the step based system and grid based movement.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I addressed it by dedicating extra time to refining the algorithm and adapting it to fit the project. It ended up working brilliantly.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + I really enjoyed working with the team on this project‚Äîdefinitely my favorite part. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + If I did this all over again, I‚Äôd spend more time on planning and creating more specific issues; I felt like the ones I made were a bit too open-ended. Which leads to some miscommunication. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + The most valuable thing I learned from this project is that you can depend on others who share your passion. A good team can make development feel smooth and seamless.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My roll was programming. The stories I worked on were Item Stats, Player Stats, Enemy Stats, and Shop. Overlapping with Alex because I needed help with parts of these.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest challenge for me was learning the Unity GUI and how to use it along with code.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I'm very much used to using code editors only and not GUIs. There were some issues I came across where I had to fix by entering the hierachy or accessing a component or such.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + Ultimately my teammates with more experience than me guiding me in the right direction. Without them I think I would of been stuck on simple issues for hours.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Working as a team in this game development project. I feel like I've made life long friends and we plan to create a project 4 over Winter Break!
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would watch Prof. G's Unity lectures that Kyle provided in a Google Drive. I think I would of been a more efficient teammate had I done so.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + An introspection of where I want to be in terms of game development skills compared to my peers. And the amount of work I need to put in to be as helpful as them.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
 I worked primarily as a technical artist, which is a fancy way of saying I split my time between writing code and making art assets. I tried to focus on making our game look good with a nice high contrast color palette that is both pleasing to the eye and friendly to our colorblind brothers and sisters. For the code, I focused on making a series of scripts that manage the dialogue and scripts related to the shop/progression.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
   I think one of my biggest challenges during this project was knowing what to priritize and then getting bottlenecked because one feature was dependant on another feature that had not been completed yet. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
  Some things took a lot longer than we expected to near the end we had to crunch to get it working. 
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  We did a good job of meeting online to talk about priorities and distribute labor in a way that made a lot of sense given each of our skillsets.  
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  I really enjoyed working in this team. I think we were successful in what we set out to do and I feel like I strengthened the bonds of friendship with my team members. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  I would like to try to do a better job of getting a playable build running as soon as practicable and then iterate from there. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  I learned what it is like to work in a very functional and very communicative team. I got a way better idea of how to use github issues and how to resolve conflicts. I also enjoyed the chance to learn more about Unity and C# 
 

## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - We believe our project to be successful. Not only did we meet our minimum viable product we were able to complete stories we didn't anticipate getting too.
- What was the largest victory?
  - We believe the largest victory to be our modified A* and Room Generation code. Those pieces of code being fundemantally core to testing further features.
- Final Assessment of the project
  - Time Taker/Simple_Roguelike was a successful project that achieved its goal of allowing users to play... a simple roguelike! üòä
