## Overview

Time Taker is a Simple Roguelike made using Unity LTS version is 2022.3.47f1.
Time Taker is a roguelike that allows you to battle monsters, progress through the dungeon, defeat the boss with a unique time rewinding mechanic.

We got styling help for this document from this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Introduction
Communication between the team was managed through daily Discord 8pm meetings and messages.
Messaging was for short communication, progress reporting and alerting out teammembers when new pull requests went up.

Originally we had around 65 stories, with the idea that some stories being stretch goals that wouldn't make it into the final product.

We added stories along the way as the project progressed as we felt we were capable of completing more. As a team we completed 53 out of 65 stories.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My roll was programming. The stories I worked on were Item Stats, Player Stats, Enemy Stats, and Shop. Overlapping with Alex because I needed help with parts of these.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest challenge for me was learning the Unity GUI and how to use it along with code.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I'm very much used to using code editors only and not GUIs. There were some issues I came across where I had to fix by entering the hierachy or accessing a component or such.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + Ultimately my teammates with more experience than me guiding me in the right direction. Without them I think I would of been stuck on simple issues for hours.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Working as a team in this game development project. I feel like I've made life long friends and we plan to create a project 4 over Winter Break!
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would watch Prof. G's Unity lectures that Kyle provided in a Google Drive. I think I would of been a more efficient teammate had I done so.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + An introspection of where I want to be in terms of game development skills compared to my peers. And the amount of work I need to put in to be as helpful as them.
